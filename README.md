[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-qr-reader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-qr-reader)

## Introduction
A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) component for reading QR codes from the webcam. It uses the WebRTC standards for reading webcam data and [jsQR](https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR) is used for detecting QR codes in that data. To optimise the speed and experience, a web-worker is used to offload the heavy QR code algorithm on a separate process. The web worker is inlined and loaded on creation of the component.

## Demo
[thomasbilliet.com/react-qr-reader](https://thomasbilliet.com/react-qr-reader)

## Known Issues
- Due to browser implementations the camera can only be accessed over https or localhost.
- In Firefox a prompt will be shown to the user asking which camera to use, so `facingMode` will not affect it.
- On IOS 11 it is only supported on Safari and not on Chrome or Firefox due to Apple making the API not available to 3th party browsers.
- If you've set the [`Content Security Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) header for `script-src` or `worker-src`, you'll need to add `worker-src 'blob:'`.

## Install
`npm install --save react-qr-reader`

## Example

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import QrReader from 'react-qr-reader'

class Test extends Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      delay: 300,
      result: 'No result',
    }
    this.handleScan = this.handleScan.bind(this)
  }
  handleScan(data){
    if(data){
      this.setState({
        result: data,
      })
    }
  }
  handleError(err){
    console.error(err)
  }
  render(){
    return(
      <div>
        <QrReader
          delay={this.state.delay}
          onError={this.handleError}
          onScan={this.handleScan}
          style={{ width: '100%' }}
          />
        <p>{this.state.result}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

## Props
### Events
| Prop        | Argument         | Description
|-------------|------------------|-------------
| onScan      | `result`         | Scan event handler. Called every scan with the decoded value or `null` if no QR code was found.
| onError     | `Error`          | Called when an error occurs.
| onLoad      | none             | Called when the component is ready for use.
| onImageLoad | img onLoad event | Called when the image in legacyMode is loaded.

### Options
| Prop           | Type                    | Default       | Description
|----------------|-------------------------|---------------|-------------
| delay          | number or `false`       | `500`         | The delay between scans in milliseconds. To disable the interval pass in `false`.
| facingMode     | `user` or `environment` | `environment` | Specify which camera should be used (if available).
| resolution     | number                  | `600`         | The resolution of the video (or image in legacyMode). Larger resolution will increase the accuracy but it will also slow down the processing time.
| style          | a valid React style     | none          | Styling for the container element. **Warning** The preview will always keep its 1:1 aspect ratio.
| className      | string                  | none          | ClassName for the container element.
| showViewFinder | boolean                 | `true`        | Show or hide the build in view finder. See demo
| legacyMode     | boolean                 | `false`       | If the device does not allow camera access (e.g. IOS Browsers, Safari) you can enable legacyMode to allow the user to take a picture (On a mobile device) or use an existing one. To trigger the image dialog just call the method `openImageDialog` from the parent component. **Warning** You must call the method from a user action (eg. click event on some element).
